# odin-etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-Sketch for The Odin Project

As with the last project, I coded this in a few hours and entirely forgot to have a commit structure. Still, it works, with all the required functions plus a few. This helped me learn a lot more about HTML/CSS interaction with JS, and how to utilize functional programming in JS. I want to come back and add to this and fix it up at some point, after I learn more about each.
